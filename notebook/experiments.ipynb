The model takes sequential text as \\nan input and then predicts what the following token should be, based on the data it was \\ntrained on. The LLM is operationalized to do this over and over again, adding the previously \\npredicted token to the end of the sequential text for predicting the following token. The next \\ntoken prediction is based on the relationship between what’s in the previous tokens and what \\nthe LLM has seen during its training. \\nWhen you write a prompt, you are attempting to set up the LLM to predict the right sequence \\nof tokens. Prompt engineering is the process of designing high-quality prompts that guide \\nLLMs to produce accurate outputs. This process involves tinkering to find the best prompt, \\noptimizing prompt length, and evaluating a prompt’s writing style and structure in relation \\nto the task. In the context of natural language processing and LLMs, a prompt is an input \\nprovided to the model to generate a response or prediction.'),\n",

The model can then \\nexplore different reasoning paths by branching out from different nodes in the tree. \\nThere’s a great notebook, which goes into a bit more detail showing The Tree of Thought \\n(ToT) which is based on the paper ‘Large Language Model Guided Tree-of-Thought’.9\\nReAct (reason & act)\\nReason and act (ReAct) [10]13 prompting is a paradigm for enabling LLMs to solve complex \\ntasks using natural language reasoning combined with external tools (search, code \\ninterpreter etc.) allowing the LLM to perform certain actions, such as interacting with external \\nAPIs to retrieve information which is a first step towards agent modeling.\\nReAct mimics how humans operate in the real world, as we reason verbally and can \\ntake actions to gain information. ReAct performs well against other prompt engineering \\napproaches in a variety of domains.\\nReAct prompting works by combining reasoning and acting into a thought-action loop. The \\nLLM first reasons about the problem and generates a plan of action. It then performs the \\nactions in the plan and observes the results. The LLM then uses the observations to update \\nits reasoning and generate a new plan of action. This process continues until the LLM \\nreaches a solution to the problem.\\nTo see this in action, you need to write some code.

But what about input? While JSON is excellent for structuring the output the LLM \\ngenerates, it can also be incredibly useful for structuring the input you provide. This is where \\nJSON Schemas come into play. A JSON Schema defines the expected structure and data \\ntypes of your JSON input. By providing a schema, you give the LLM a clear blueprint of the \\ndata it should expect, helping it focus its attention on the relevant information and reducing \\nthe risk of misinterpreting the input. Furthermore, schemas can help establish relationships \\nbetween different pieces of data and even make the LLM \"time-aware\" by including date or \\ntimestamp fields with specific formats.\\nHere\\'s a simple example:\\nLet\\'s say you want to use an LLM to generate descriptions for products in an e-commerce \\ncatalog. Instead of just providing a free-form text description of the product, you can use a \\nJSON schema to define the product\\'s attributes:\\nSnippet 5.

Generally \\nspeaking, when using reasoning, to come up with the final answer, there’s likely one single \\ncorrect answer. Therefore the temperature should always set to 0. \\nDocument the various prompt attempts\\nThe last tip was mentioned before in this chapter, but we can’t stress enough how important \\nit is: document your prompt attempts in full detail so you can learn over time what went well \\nand what did not. \\nPrompt outputs can differ across models, across sampling settings, and even across different \\nversions of the same model. Moreover, even across identical prompts to the same model, \\nsmall differences in output sentence formatting and word choice can occur. (For example, as \\nmentioned previously, if two tokens have the same predicted probability, ties may be broken \\nrandomly. This can then impact subsequent predicted tokens.).'),\n",

The advantages of \\nthis approach are that you have a complete record when you inevitably have to revisit your \\nprompting work–either to pick it up in the future (you’d be surprised how much you can \\nforget after just a short break), to test prompt performance on different versions of a model, \\nand to help debug future errors.\\nBeyond the fields in this table, it’s also helpful to track the version of the prompt (iteration), \\na field to capture if the result was OK/NOT OK/SOMETIMES OK, and a field to capture \\nfeedback. If you’re lucky enough to be using Vertex AI Studio, save your prompts (using the \\nsame name and version as listed in your documentation) and track the hyperlink to the saved \\nprompt in the table. This way, you’re always one click away from re-running your prompts.\\nWhen working on a retrieval augmented generation system, you should also capture the \\nspecific aspects of the RAG system that impact what content was inserted into the prompt, \\nincluding the query, chunk settings, chunk output, and other information.\\nOnce you feel the prompt is close to perfect, take it to your project codebase. And in the \\ncodebase, save prompts in a separate file from code, so it’s easier to maintain. Finally, ideally \\nyour prompts are part of an operationalized system, and as a prompt engineer you should \\nrely on automated tests and evaluation procedures to understand how well your prompt \\ngeneralizes to a task.\\nPrompt engineering is an iterative process.
